**Trump&#39;s Immigration Policies Could Cost a Lot for New York Universitiesâ€”A $4 Billion Industry**

By Nour Saudi and Rajan Zaveri

Donald Trump&#39;s hard stance against immigrants since he took office has left New York universities fearful and uncertain of their future. This has already had serious repercussions on universities. In a recent [survey](http://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/TrendTopic/Immigration/intl-survey-results-released.pdf?sfvrsn=0) of 250 colleges, 40 percent have reported a decline in international applications, citing fear of the Trump administration as a factor.

The report showed that the highest number of application declines were from Middle Eastern countries, many of whom were a target in Trump&#39;s travel ban. Though the ban has been blocked by federal judges twice now, it has had lasting effects on universities.

&quot;There is a lot of anxiety out there, you know, students are scared,&quot; said Ruth Kamona, director of International Student &amp; Scholar Services at CUNY. &quot;They don&#39;t know what the end result will be or where this is headed, so of course students are very concerned.&quot;

Kamona said the school advises students to know their rights and to avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She also tells students to carry copies of their documentation wherever they go.

CUNY hosts more than 8,000 international students from over 100 countries. Kamona has said the new immigration policies could affect students like these in the future.

&quot;Something we can say for sure is that the consulates abroad will be very careful about issuing visas, especially from certain countries,&quot; she said. &quot;They are being asked to do extra things, extra vetting before they issue any visas, so the scrutiny out there is going to be very strict.&quot;

If there is a sharp decline in international students in the future, universities will suffer the consequences. International students contributed more than $32 billion to the US economy in the last school year, providing over 400,000 jobs, according to data collected by [NAFSA](http://www.nafsa.org/Policy_and_Advocacy/Policy_Resources/Policy_Trends_and_Data/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/). This is enough money to cover all 516,000 CUNY students&#39; tuitions for the next 10 years.

In New York alone, international students [contributed](https://istart.iu.edu/nafsa/reports/state.cfm?state=NY&amp;year=2015) about $4 billion to the economy last year, a figure which has helped sustain universities who could now face serious danger due to Trump&#39;s proposed [budget cuts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-presidential-budget-2018-proposal/?utm_term=.e8566d0a27f2#dept-4) on education.

Resident students, who often rely on federal aid to pay for their tuition, will suffer as a result. CUNY students received $557 million in federal aid last year, which international and undocumented students are not eligible for. But CUNY, a public university, has also been able to remain fairly inexpensive because of the contributions of international students. A [report](http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/pdf/rr16-859.pdf) from the University of Michigan states that international student admission directly affects tuition. Because out-of-country students often pay double the tuition, public universities are able to keep costs low for in-state residents. Without this revenue, resident students would suffer the cost.

Trump&#39;s immigration policies also affect schools academically. The order banning immigrants from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen impacts about 15,000 students studying here from those countries.  According to the Institute for International Education, Iranians [make up](http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/International-Students/Leading-Places-of-Origin/2014-16) 12,000 of those students, who often come to the US to pursue PhDs or Master&#39;s degrees.

&quot;The students from other countries are often top-tier students and go on to contribute to the economy in significant ways,&quot; said Jeff Lieberson, from the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities.

According to data from [SEVIS](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/byTheNumbersDec2016.pdf), business, engineering and computer science make up some of the top majors pursued by international students. About 78 percent of Iranian students who study in the US go into STEM fields. The worry for universities in New York lies in losing a great number of these students who play a big role in technological and scientific advancements, not just revenue. International and undocumented students both contribute greatly to the academic world, said Lieberson. Without them, these fields would take a big hit.

&quot;All six of the 2016 US-based Nobel prize winners in economics and the scientific fields were not born in the United States,&quot; he said.

Margaret Satterthwaite, a professor at the NYU School of Law, is especially concerned about the academic consequences of not having international students here.

&quot;For me, as a human rights advocate and a human rights professor, it&#39;s incredibly important for me that we have international students in our classrooms and certainly in our advocacy work,&quot; she said.

Satterthwaite said international students bring an important perspective to academia, that lends to a more collaborative environment.

&quot;One of the things I try and teach students is to be accountable to the communities whose rights are most impacted,&quot; she said. &quot;If we can have those folks in the classroom it really changes and really distorts the kind of discussion we are trying to create and need to have.&quot;

New York University is currently one of the leading universities in enrollment of international students. These students have [contributed](https://istart.iu.edu/nafsa/reports/state.cfm?state=NY&amp;year=2015) $680 million to the economy, owing to about 9,000 jobs. After the first travel ban was passed in January, one NYU student, PhD candidate Saira Rafiee was [detained](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Protest-Travel-Ban-Donald-Trump-President-Immigration-New-York-CUNY-Students-Detained-412153023.html) on her way back from Iran. This led NYU students and faculty to collectively protest and call for her re-admittance.

Though Rafiee has since returned to her studies, the organizing on campus has continued. NYU students are part of a coalition of university students in New York that advocate for sanctuary campuses to protect immigrants.

Nour Obeidallah, an NYU student, spoke at the women&#39;s strike rally in New York on behalf of the sanctuary movement, calling for open doors to immigrant students, like herself, who are just seeking an education.

&quot;In a moment of profound uncertainty for so many, our universities must allocate their financial resources to aid threatened populations throughout New York City,&quot; she said to the crowd at Washington Square Park, calling for &quot;citywide resistance to the Trump administration.&quot;

CUNY Dreamers are also part of this sanctuary movement to advocate for the rights of undocumented students. At their last meeting in February, students spoke about their fears of being deported in light of Trump&#39;s harsher stance on undocumented immigrants.

Most of the Dreamers are DACA students, protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy which allows a renewable two-year period of deferment from deportation. However, students at the meeting still voiced concerns that this wouldn&#39;t be enough, especially when they graduate. The CUNY Dreamers are seeking a pathway to citizenship, and they&#39;ve felt the new administration has threatened that possibility.

&quot;Children who were brought to the United States in an undocumented fashion, through no fault of their own, are here and this is the only country that many of them have known,&quot; said Lieberson. &quot;There is still obviously a need for much more comprehensive immigration reform.&quot;

Alma Ramales, 19, is a Dreamer student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. She came from Mexico in 1999, when she was a year old. Though she has spent almost her entire life in the United States, she is living in fear because of Trump&#39;s immigration policies.

&quot;It worries me. Because me, I don&#39;t have a criminal record or anything, but I could be the next one deported any day now,&quot; she said.

After passing an executive order calling for more deportations, there have been increased immigration raids all over the country. Trump has also [proposed](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/read-the-memos-signed-by-dhs-secretary-kelly-on-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants/2338/) to hire 5,000 Border Patrol officers and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

These proposals have left undocumented immigrants fearful of their future, like Ramales, who is studying to become a nurse. Ramales visited Mexico for the first time since she left as a baby in January, one week before Trump was inaugurated.

&quot;It was a huge risk. I felt scared, it&#39;s a whole new environment. After I got the opportunity to actually meet my grandparents, it felt new,&quot; she said. &quot;That was a good way of going over there, but just imagine a bad way, actually getting deported.&quot;

Ramales said she just wants to be accepted as an American, and to pursue the same dreams as other students who are citizens.

&quot;I actually wanted to become a police officer. But I couldn&#39;t because the requirement was to be a US citizen or at least have a green card, she said. &quot;By the time you take the test, you&#39;re supposed to be a US citizen, and I&#39;m not. So it was just like, my dream was just crushed.&quot;

She said many Dreamers have dreams of serving this country, which to most of them feels like the only home they&#39;ve ever known.

&quot;Some of us dreamt to join the military but we don&#39;t have that chance like other kids that are born here,&quot; said Ramales. &quot;Even though I&#39;ve been here, I was raised here.&quot;

Satterthwaite said she has many Mexican students who felt the same uncertainty after Trump was elected. She said many of them felt unwelcome.

&quot;All of these things together is creating an atmosphere where people just do not want to cross the border,&quot; said Satterthwaite.

Many universities are anxious to see how these fears will effect enrollment in the fall. Students like Ramales are uncertain about any new executive orders to come, as their fate here remains unknown. Ramales stressed the importance of allowing students from other countries to study here.

&quot;We&#39;re not all bad people. Especially the kids. We were brought here without our consent. We didn&#39;t even ask to be brought here,&quot; she said. &quot;And most of our parents either come here for a job or to give us a better life.&quot;
