                    <p>With graduation day just around the corner, Saher Jafri finds herself in the same boat as many of her classmates: struggling to find a job. But for Jafri, the struggle is more than just a need for a stable income—her life in the US
                        relies on it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;As an international student from India who grew up in Saudi Arabia, Jafri has to go through many hurdles before getting work authorization, including applying for an Optional Practical Training F-1 visa, which would allow her
                        to work in her field of study for one year. </p>
                    <p>Jafri always dreamed of working in her field, but the authorization requirements and OPT visa made it seem impossible. With all the work and money she’s put into studying while in New York, Jafri said the government should provide
                        pathways to careers for international students like her. </p>
                    <p>She worries now, as a soon-to-be graduate from Stony Brook University with a degree in business, that this will affect her chances of being hired in her field. </p>
                    <p>“It’s detrimental to my application process, because I have no job experience,” she said.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, she spends over $50,000 while studying and living in New York per year. This is common for many international students studying at private universities, where they are expected to pay full tuition out-of-pocket, usually
                        through sponsorship by a family member.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;Jafri is one of over 4,000 international students at Stony Brook, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). These students contribute almost $94 million just in tuition alone. For most international
                        students, that tuition comes out-of-pocket, with families sponsoring their education.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;These expenses are harder to deal with for international students because they aren’t authorized to work off-campus.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;“I’m still searching for an on-campus job,” said Sujay Paraeala, an international student studying industrial engineering at New York University. Sujay came from Bangalore, India to find better work opportunities here.
                    </p>
                    <p>New York University is currently one of the leading universities in enrollment of international students. In 2015, they had over 12,000 students, most who came from India, like Paraeala.</p><br />

                    <p>According to the data from NCES, there were about 97,000 international students enrolled in New York universities alone in 2015. A study conducted by NAFSA, an association of international educators, estimated that these students contributed
                        almost $4 billion to the economy from their tuition, fees, and living expenses. For Jafri, these are expenses she is familiar with as a student who is solely sponsored by her parents.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;“I’ve contributed so much in terms of money,” said Jafri. “With out-of-state tuition and fees, I paid like on average $30,000 a year on tuition, and $15,000 on other fees.”</p>
                    <p>These economic contributions are believed to be a factor in why in-state tuition is so much lower for residents. According to a report from the University of Michigan, international student admission directly affects tuition. Because
                        out-of-country students often pay double the tuition, public universities are able to keep costs low for in-state residents. Without this revenue, resident students would suffer the cost.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I've contributed so much in terms of money." - Saher Jafri, student from Saudi Arabia.</blockquote>
                    <p>This is becoming more of a concern as data shows a decline in applications from foreign students. In a recent survey of 250 colleges conducted by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, AACRAO, 40
                        percent have reported a decline in international applications. Experts cited fear of the Trump administration as a factor.</p>
                    <p>"There is a lot of anxiety out there, you know, students are scared," said Ruth Kamona, director of International Student &amp; Scholar Services at the City University of New York, CUNY. "They don't know what the end result will be
                        or where this is headed, so of course students are very concerned."</p>
                    <p>However, as enrollment only officially begins in the fall, most universities are waiting to see how much these declines in applications will affect them.</p>
                    <p>"What this really indicates to us is that schools should reach out to international students and let them know that they will provide extra support services," said Sharon Witherell from the Institute of International Education.</p>
                    <p>For Jafri, the international office at Stony Brook has been a great advisor. But Jafri is considering pursuing a Master’s in another country after graduation.</p>
                    <p>“The more I stayed here, the more I felt unwelcome,” she said. “There are so many restrictions on people who aren’t citizens.”</p>
                    <p>Paraeala also plans to leave the US to move back to India, but hopes to work for a few years in the United States first. But, even with all the money and diversity that international students bring to the US, a future in the career
                        world isn’t guaranteed.</p>
